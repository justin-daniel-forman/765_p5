----------------- User's guide for HOPE ----------------------------

NAME:    hope --- a parallel fault simulator for
		  synchronous sequential circuits.

SYNOPSIS: hope [options] circuit_file [> outfile]

OPTIONS: Several options are available for hope.
         If an option is not specified, the default value is used.

-c fn    Options are read from the file "fn".
	 (default: online command mode)
-D       The list of faults which are newly detected by a test pattern
         is reported in the log file. The option -l should be
         specified. (default: only the number of faults
         detected is reported.)
-f fn    Faults are defined in the file "fn".
	 (default: faults are generated internally)
-F fn    The good and faulty circuit outputs are reported for
         each fault in the file fn. Naturally, no fault is dropped, 
	 i.e., all the faults are injected and simulated in parallel
	 for each test pattern.
         (default: faulty circuit output is not reported.)
-h f     Displays an example fault list format.
-h g     Displays the on-line user's guide.
-h n     Displays an example netlist format.
-h t     Displays an example test pattern file.
-h a     Displays the entire on-line manual file.
         (default: no manual is displayed)
-l fn    A log file named "fn" is created. 
	 (default: no logfile is created)
-N       Diagnostic mode
         No fault dropping is performed, i.e., all the faults
         are simulated for each test pattern.
         (default: faults detected during the fault simulation are
         dropped from the fault list.)
-r n	 (Random pattern generation mode)
         Test patterns are generated randomly. The fault simulation
	 stops either when all faults are detected or n patterns
	 are applied.  (default: -r 224)
-s n	 Initial seed for the random number generator is set by n.
         If n=0, random seed is generated using the day time of 
         the computer. (default: -s 0)
-t fn    Test patterns are provided in the file "fn"
	 (default: random patterns are used)
-u       Prints out all undetected faults in a file. The name of this
         file is <ckt>.ufaults. Note that hope does not update a fault
         file if one already exists in the run directory. This fault list
         file can be directly read by atalanta or hope.
         (default: no file is created)
-U fn    The same as -u, but hope writes undetected faults to the given
         file name.
         (default: no file is created)
-x	 (Potential detection mode)
         Potentially detected faults are dropped as soon as
         they are detected. 
	 (default: only detected faults are dropped)
-0	 All the flip-flops are initially set to logic 0 
-1	 All the flip-flops are initially set to logic 1
         (default: All the flip-flops are initially set to unknown (X).)

OUTPUTS: In default mode, no file is created. The summary
         of the fault simulation is reported to the standard
         output. If the option -l is specified, hope
         creates a log file. The log file contains more detailed
         information about the fault simulation.
 
ON-LINE HELP: Type hope to see the available on-line
         help command.

EXAMPLES:
         hope -t s27.test s27.bench
            --- simulates the circuit s27.bench using the test
                patterns in the file "s27.test". The fault simulation
                stops when all test patterns in the file "s27.test"
                are simulated or all faults are detected.
                The summary of the fault simulation is reported
                to the standard output (CRT terminal).

         hope -s 9999 -r 20000 s27.bench > s27.out
            --- simulates the circuit s27.bench using 20000 random
                patterns. The random pattern generator is initialized
                by 9999. The fault simulation stops when 20000
                random patterns are simulated or all faults are
                detected, whichever is earlier. The summary of the 
		fault simulation is reported to the file "s27.out".

         hope -f s27.fault -t s27.test -l s27.dict -N -D s27.bench
            --- reads the fault list from the file "s27.fault" and
                simulates faults in a diagnostic mode, i.e., no fault
                dropping is applied. The result of fault simulation
                is reported in the log file "s27.dict". In the log
                file, the list of faults detected by each test 
		pattern is reported.
